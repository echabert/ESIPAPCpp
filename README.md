# ESIPAP: Edition 2022 - Module 1
#   Computing Session


## Lecturers:
  - Eric Chabert
  - Eric Conte


## Required packages:
  - C++ compiler
  - [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html)
  - [git](https://github.com/)
  - [ROOT](https://root.cern.ch/)


## Installation of the packages:
 
The computing sessions requires to a fully-operational system with all the packages installed and configured. The preparation of your system must be done before the computing sessions: there will be no time during these sessions for installing the missing packages.
Two solutions are proposed for having your system ready:

  - Solution 1: Downloading and using an image of a pre-configured Linux distribution with the help of the program VirtualBox. [Please follow these instructions](doc/install/VirtualBox.md).
  - Solution 2: Installing step-by-step the required packages on your own system. The instructions will depend on the OS (Operator System): 
    - [Windows](doc/install/Windows.md) NOT RECOMMENDED: do not work yet = need of a patch from the ROOT authors.
    - [Windows](doc/install/Windows2.md) RECOMMENDED: using previous releases = ROOT 5 and Visual Studio 2013.
    - [Linux](doc/install/Linux.md)
    - [macOS](doc/install/macOS.md)

## Check of the setup:
 
If you use the Solution 1 with the Linux image,  you can skip this section because the setup is already well configured. If you use the Solution 2, you need to check that everything works properly and that you are ready to begin the computing sessions. The instructions depend also on the OS (Operator System):
  - [Windows](doc/check/Windows.md)
  - [Linux/macOS](doc/check/Linux.md)
	
## Creation of github account

It will be required to create github repositories during the computing sessions.
We ask you to to it before the beginning of the sessions.
